  addresses their ongoing medical need.

  As a worldwide community, we have adopted these guidelines:
  1.  Every person deserves the best healthcare possible, regardless of where they live.
  2.  To tht end, it is the responsibility of economically enriched countries to come to the aid of people in
  economically developing countries or countries where disaster relief is greatly needed.
